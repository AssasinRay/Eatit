Bug: can't store user registration info into the database.
Solution: in the insert statement, surround PHP variables with single quotes, and use 'PASSWORD' as the column name rather than 'password'.

Bug: Failed to store username into sessionStorage.
Solution: don't use PHP "header()" function to redirect, use JavaScript "window.location" instead.
